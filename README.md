# AddMoveRotateRemoveObjects
 Simple Unity Example to add, move, rotate and remove objects dynamically

In this Unity example project, you can have a Unity scene with some basic UIs to add a predefined objects stored on Resources folder to the scene, then click and drag the object to position it anywhere, rotate it left and right, and you can also remove it.

There are two cameras in this example scene, eye level view and top view. You need to switch to top view to move, rotate and remove objects. There is a camera toggle button to switch between top view and eye level view.
